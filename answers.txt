What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Git merge creates a new merge commit in the feature branch that has the history of both the main and feature branches. 
Git rebase creates a linear structure and moves the entire feature branch to begin on the tip of the main branch.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository maintains the version of the code on the internet versus the local computer and can be accessed from 
anywhere even if you don't have your computer.
